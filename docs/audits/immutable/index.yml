# Immutable evidence index (authoritative)
#
# This file is intentionally human-editable and diff-friendly.
# It is meant to power:
# - MkDocs pages listing snapshots and locations
# - CI snapshot-replay selection logic (changed-only)
# - Rollup consolidation bookkeeping

version: 1

# Each entry should describe either an expanded snapshot or a rollup member.
# Schema is intentionally minimal for now; expand as we wire replay tooling.
entries: []
