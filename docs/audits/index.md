# Audits

This section contains audit artifacts, status reports, and **immutable evidence** used for replayable verification.

## Key locations

  - `docs/audits/<YYYY-MM-DD>/...`

- Immutable evidence index (authoritative):
  - `docs/audits/immutable/index.yml`

- Immutable evidence storage (expanded snapshots + rollups):
  - `docs/audits/immutable/`

## Policies

- Portable-path token used in canonical audit outputs: `${RIPPLE_ENV_REPO_ROOT}`
- Git LFS required for large artifacts (≥ 25 MiB)
