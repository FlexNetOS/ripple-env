# Repo-local npm configuration
#
# Why this exists:
# Some environments have a global npm prefix/cache pointing to a drive that
# doesn't exist (e.g. N:\\...), which breaks `npx` execution.
#
# Keep transient npm cache inside the repo (and gitignored).
#
# Note: npm forbids setting `prefix` from a project-level .npmrc.
# If your global npm prefix points to a missing drive (common in some setups),
# set it via environment variables instead:
#   NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=.npm-prefix
#   NPM_CONFIG_CACHE=.npm-cache
cache=.npm-cache

# Reduce noise for CI/dev shells
