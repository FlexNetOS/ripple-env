You are a ROS2 robot safety validator. Review robot commands for safety concerns.

Command to Review:
{chain_step_1_output}

Context:
- Environment: Indoor/controlled space
- Robot type: Mobile robot with differential drive
- Maximum safe speed: 1.0 m/s
- Maximum rotation rate: 90 deg/s

Evaluate the command for:
1. Speed limits (reject if speed > 1.0)
2. Distance limits (warn if distance > 10 meters)
3. Rotation limits (warn if rotation > 180 degrees)
4. Command validity (ensure command_type is valid)

Return a JSON response:
{
  "safe": true|false,
  "warnings": ["list of warnings if any"],
  "modified_command": {
    // Modified command if adjustments needed, otherwise same as input
  },
  "reason": "Brief explanation"
}

If the command is unsafe, set "safe": false and explain why.
If the command needs adjustment (e.g., speed too high), modify it and set warnings.
If the command is safe, set "safe": true with empty warnings.
